[![Contribute](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributions-Welcome-brightgreen.svg)](CONTRIBUTING.md)

This project leverages AI to enhance customer retention for SBI Life Insurance by moving beyond persona-based recommendations to deliver truly personalized, individual-centric experiences.  The chatbot analyzes customer interactions to understand their unique preferences and needs, optimizing upselling strategies and improving customer persistency.

## Project Description

SBI Life currently utilizes a broad, persona-based approach for customer recommendations, which lacks individual-level depth and often fails to resonate with unique customer preferences. This project aims to solve this by building an AI-driven chatbot that:

*   **Deepens Individual-Centric Insights:**  Develops a personalized understanding of customer behavior, preferences, and needs based on their interactions.
*   **Optimizes Upselling Strategies:** Suggests tailored policy terms, ticket prices, and durations to increase customer satisfaction and policy upgrades.
*   **Improves Customer Persistency:** Enhances the likelihood of prospective customers closing deals and existing customers maintaining their policies by providing relevant and personalized guidance.

This chatbot leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with OpenAI to provide contextually relevant and personalized responses based on similar past customer interactions stored in a vector database.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:**
    *   React
    *   JavaScript (ES6+)
    *   CSS
    *   npm/Node.js
    *   Lucide React (Icons)

*   **Backend:**
    *   Python
    *   Flask
    *   Sentence Transformers (for embeddings)
    *   LLM (for response generation)
    *   Pinecone (Vector Database)
    *   PyMuPDF (for PDF processing)

## Problem Statement

SBI Life currently relies on a 1000+ user persona-based approach for customer behavior recommendation, which limits the depth of individual-centric analysis and fails to resonate with their unique preference, reducing the likelihood of conversion.

## Goal

To leverage AI to:

*   **Deepen individual-centric insights:** Develop a more personalized understanding of customer behavior, preferences, and needs.
*   **Optimize upselling strategies:** Suggest tailored policy terms, ticket prices, and durations to increase customer satisfaction and retention.
*   **Improve customer persistency:** Enhance the likelihood of prospective customers closing deals and existing customers maintaining their policies.

## Key Features

*   **Personalized Chatbot Interface:** A user-friendly React-based chatbot interface for customer interaction.
*   **AI-Powered Recommendations:**  Utilizes Custom_LLM and RAG to generate personalized responses and recommendations based on context and past interactions.
*   **Vector Database (Pinecone) Integration:** Stores and retrieves conversation embeddings for semantic similarity search and personalized context.
*   **Dynamic Persona Creation:**  For returning customers, the chatbot builds a dynamic "persona" based on their individual interaction history.
*   **Similarity-Based Guidance:** For new customers, the chatbot leverages similar past customer interactions to guide them towards successful purchase paths.
*   **Scalable Backend:**  Built with Flask and Python for a modular and scalable backend architecture.
*   **PDF Data Ingestion:**  Includes scripts to ingest PDF policy documents into the Pinecone knowledge base.
*   **Audio Support (Future Enhancement):**  Planned feature to enable voice input and output for a more seamless user experience.
*   **Accurate RAG with SBI Data Sources:**  Focuses on utilizing official SBI Life data sources to ensure accurate and reliable information retrieval for RAG.
*   **Sales and Support Guidance:** Aims to provide effective sales guidance and customer support information within the chatbot conversations.
*   **Multi-Language Support (Future Enhancement):**  Intended to support multiple languages, including Hindi and English, to cater to a wider customer base.
*   **Individual Customer Persona:** Leverages historical customer data to create and refine individual customer personas for deeper personalization.
*   **And More:**  Continuously evolving with new features and improvements to enhance customer retention and personalization.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

**Backend Setup:**

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`
2.  Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended): `python -m venv venv`
3.  Activate the virtual environment:
    *   On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    *   On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
4.  Install backend dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5.  Set your environment variables:
    *   `PINECONE_API_KEY`
    *   `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`
    *   `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`
    (You can set these in a `.env` file in the `backend` directory)
6.  Run the Flask backend: `python run.py`

**Frontend Setup:**

1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend`
2.  Install frontend dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3.  Start the React frontend development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`

The chatbot interface should now be accessible in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`. The backend API will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
