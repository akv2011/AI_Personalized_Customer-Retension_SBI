# Implementation Plan: Pop-up Chatbot

This document outlines the steps to implement a pop-up chatbot feature.

## Frontend Implementation (React)

1.  **Create a New Webpage Component:**
    *   Develop a new React component for the webpage where the chatbot icon will reside.
    *   This could be an existing page or a new route/page depending on the application structure.
    *   Example: `src/components/MainPage.js`

2.  **Design a Chatbot Icon:**
    *   Create or select an appropriate icon to represent the chatbot.
    *   Place this icon on the new webpage component, likely in a fixed position (e.g., bottom-right corner).
    *   Use CSS for styling and positioning.

3.  **Implement Chatbot Component:**
    *   Reuse or enhance the existing `src/components/ChatInterface.js`.
    *   Ensure it can function as a pop-up or modal window.

4.  **Add Pop-up Logic:**
    *   Use React state (e.g., `useState`) in the parent component (e.g., `MainPage.js` or `App.js`) to manage the visibility of the chatbot pop-up.
    *   Add an `onClick` handler to the chatbot icon.
    *   When the icon is clicked, update the state to show the `ChatInterface` component.
    *   The `ChatInterface` component should have a way to be closed (e.g., a close button), which would update the state back to hidden.

5.  **Styling:**
    *   Style the pop-up chat interface using CSS (`App.css`, `index.css`, or component-specific CSS) to appear as a modal or pop-up window above the page content.
    *   Ensure responsiveness for different screen sizes.

## Backend Implementation (Python/Flask - if needed)

*   No direct changes are required for the pop-up mechanism itself, as this is primarily a frontend interaction.
*   Ensure the existing backend API (`backend/src/api/app.py`) is running and the frontend `ChatInterface.js` can communicate with it correctly once opened.
